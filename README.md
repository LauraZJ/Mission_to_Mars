# Mission_to_Mars
## Purpose
This was a webscraping excercise in which we used multiple tools including Splinter, BeautifulSoup, Python, Mongo, and HTML.  We used these tools to webscrape Mission to Mars data.

## Deliverable 1  Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
This task required scraping the website to find and retrieve the links for the full images of the mars hemispheres as well as the title of the images. My code and the result is below.

## Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Marsâ€™s Hemisphere Images and Titles
This task required updating the scraping and index files so that the mars hemisphere images would be added to the webpage.  The added images are:

![hemisphere images]()

## Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
In this task, we were asked add bootstrap components to change the web page.  I elected to change the color of the scrape button and the format of the table.  For the scrape button, I chose the btn-success option as I like the green color.  For the table format, I chose to use the table-striped option because it has a crisp, clean look.
